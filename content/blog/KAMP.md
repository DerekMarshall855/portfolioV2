A group academic project built by me and three others (team of four) in November 2019. This was my first game I had ever built. The team used 100% java code with no external libraries.

This project challenged the entire team, as it was most of our first times developing a complete piece of software. I did the brunt of the game programming, implementing the game loops and logic for both the type racing game and the aim trainer. This project was a great experience as the group got along very well and we were all open to criticism and honest in person code reviews. 

This product features menus, music, and two games (type racer + aim trainer). They both use an enum to change difficulty. The entire product was built from scratch using vanilla java libraries on the Eclipse IDE.

The code for this project can be found on my github or by following this [link!](https://github.com/DerekMarshall855/KAMP)
