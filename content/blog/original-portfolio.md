A frontend only portfolio built using react and typescript. This was my original portfolio before I became more proficient at frontend development. Everything here was built by me from scratch, unlike my current portfolio which is generated using HUGO. Similar to most of my projects this pages is fully dynamic and viewable from any size of screen.

The [`Original Portfolio`](https://derekmarshall855.github.io/myportfolio) frontend is currently hosted on gitpages. The code for this project can be found on my github or by following this [link!](https://github.com/DerekMarshall855/myportfolio)
