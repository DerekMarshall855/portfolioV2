An amazon webstore clone built on the MERN stack. All of the frontend is built using typescript, while the backend was developed using vanilla js. It includes a backend API for orders, products, and users, a dynamic frontend with vanilla css and typescript, web tokens for user authentication, password salting and encryption, a react-redux store for statefulness, and detailed schema for data storage.

The [`Amazon Webstore Clone`](https://webstore-clone.netlify.app/) frontend is currently hosted on weblify, with the backend being hosted on Heroku. The code for this project can be found on my github or by following this [link!](https://github.com/DerekMarshall855/AmazonClone)
