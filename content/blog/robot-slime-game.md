A game built for the GDU-5 game jam over the March 27-29 weekend. The game was built by me and a friend using the Godot game enginee for 2d development.


<!--more-->

This game jam was a large endevour for me as I had never developed a game before, let alone programmed using GDScript. Over the course of the weekend I learned how to create pixel art, animate, create state machines, and design a level. While the game has a fair amount of bugs, I was very proud of our ability to create a working product in a realm neither me or my friend had any experience in prior over just one weekend.

The code for this project can be found on my github or by following this [link!](https://github.com/DerekMarshall855/GDU-Jam-5). Additionally, you can download the (relatively unstable) game from [itch.io](https://sirsalisburysteak.itch.io/robot-slime-fun-time).
