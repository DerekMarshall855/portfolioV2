I am a detail-oriented and self-motivated Computer Science and Psychology graduate with some experience in
software development, data analysis and problem solving. I'm passionate about computer science and
eager to expand knowledge in web development. Currently I am working on improving my skills in developing full stack
using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) as an intern at LeapGrad. On my personal time I have been learning new languages
such as Golang and C++, trying to expand my knowledge of backend and graphics development. My biggest goal is to
learn something new about web development each day at work, improving my style, efficiency, and readability. I also want
to keep expanding my knowledge in Golang and C++, pursuing either a career and graphics development (shaders, tooling, simulations, etc...)
in C++ or backend development using my new favorite language, Go.

I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University, double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology.
My overall average was a 10.2/12 or 3.7 (A-), while my computer science average was an 11/12 or 4.0 (A).
I was able to achieve high grades due to my passion for computer programming and my
high work ethic. While most of my programming experience is in an acadmeic setting, I have
done solo projects using Python, JS, TS, MERN, WebGL, Go, C#, and C++ to expand my knowledge outside of
my school and professional work.

Some of my personal interests include:
- Video Games
- Puzzles
- Board Games
- Film and TV
