I am a detail-oriented and self-motivated Computer Science and Psychology graduate with some experience in
software development, data analysis and problem solving. I'm passionate about computer science and
eager to expand knowledge in web development. Currently I am working on improving my skills in developing full stack
using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) in my own time, but am looking for work on any stack. I would prefer working
as a full stack developer, but am willing to work in a more focused backend or frontend position. My biggest goal is to
learn something new about web development every day and continuously improve in style, efficiency, and reusability.

I graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University, double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology.
My overall average was a 10.2/12 (A-), while my computer science average was an 11/12 (A).
I was able to achieve high grades due to my passion for computer programming and my
high work ethic. While most of my programming experience is in an acadmeic setting, I have
done solo projects using Python, JS, TS, MERN, and WebGL to expand my knowledge outside of
my school work.

Some of my personal interests include:
- Video Games
- Puzzles
- Board Games
- Film and TV
