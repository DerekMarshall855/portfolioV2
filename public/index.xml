      <description>&lt;p&gt;A frontend only portfolio built using react and typescript. This was my original portfolio before I became more proficient at frontend development. Everything here was built by me from scratch, unlike my current portfolio which is generated using HUGO. Similar to most of my projects this pages is fully dynamic and viewable from any size of screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A basic blog site that was inspired by twitter. Displays a vertical menu and has built in authorization and authentication. User can make and comment on posts if they are logged in. Has a backend API designed and implemented using MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS. This was the last project I did before commiting to better my CSS, which is obvious by the bland layout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am a detail-oriented and self-motivated Computer Science and Psychology graduate with some experience in software development, data analysis and problem solving. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about computer science and eager to expand knowledge in web development. Currently I am working on improving my skills in developing full stack using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) in my own time, but am looking for work on any stack. I would prefer working as a full stack developer, but am willing to work in a more focused backend or frontend position.</description>
